<html>
	<!-- Notice how everything in html is tagged like this: <tag> your code/text </tag> -->
	<!-- Notice how spacing and whitespace doesn't really matter to the computer.
	     But it does help the person reading this code figure out what's going on. -->

	<head>
	<!-- By convention, you put stuff that isn't necessarily seen
	     on the page inside the "head" tag (e.g. title, meta keywords/description,
	     javascript code, links to external files, etc.) -->

		<title> Example Title: Go CHS! </title>

<!--Below is CSS code, skip down to the body for now and jump back up here when my comments tell you to! -->

	<style> /* this is a CSS comment. it's different than an html comment.
		 	why?  because programmers in the 70s hated us. */

		body { /* the "body" tag already exists and we can customize it */
    			background-color: #F0FFFF; /* try putting in "pink" or "#F0FFFF" */

		Hello world, this is just plain text without a tag.
		Notice that I'm typing on different lines in my word processor
		but it shows up as one line on my localhost. </br>
		Unless I add in a line break.

		<p> With a paragraph tag, I am putting this line of 
			text in its own section--kind of like a textbox. </p>

		<h2> Headers are fun type of tag to spice up your text! </h2>

		<p><strong><font color="blue"> Look online for other tags you can 
			to customize your text! There are so many!</font> </strong></p>

		<!-- The following is a line of CSS.  In general--use HTML to describe
		     the structure of your page, use CSS to give it "style". ;) -->
		<!-- Get it? Because the keyword that lets you know it's CSS is "style"? -->

		<p style="color:red"> I colored this with a quick-and-dirty line of CSS. </p>

		<!-- The line above isn't the best coding practice, you will usually see
		     CSS within a <style> </style> tag (which itself is in the header tag
		     since it won't be what we actually see, but a description of what we
		     could see if we use our CSS code).  Jump back up to the head section
		     to see my CSS code, then see it in action below this comment.-->
	
		<myTag> hello there </myTag>

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS* ABOUT THINGS NOT EXEMPLIFIED IN THE CODE ABOVE 
(*frequently asked by me as I learned this stuff)
Warning: this is all pretty simplified and thus probably not 100% correct, learn more by googling it

So what is JavaScript?
	Much like CSS, an add on to HTML except with the tag <script></script>.
	Just as you use CSS to prettify your HTML, you use JS to help you "do stuff".
	"do stuff" = windows, text fields, images, embed java applets.

When do I use XML?
	To store and transport data.  Like if you're creating a web application that stores
	your contacts you would use XML to slap in the data of all those people, and your actual 
	HTML code just needs to be the structure that can hold one of your contacts.
	In other words, you won't need to do <p> Jane </p>, <p> Bob </p> every time you want to add
	a contact.
	
	Side note: If you've heard of JSON, it's just an alternative to XML.

What is JQuery?
	It's a JavaScript library.  So just extra features for your JS.
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
	Just add that in your HTML head somewhere before your actual JS code and you're good to go.

What is Bootstrap?
	<script src="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
	Another addition to your JavaScript, kind of like JQuery but it's not a library--it's a
	framework.  It basically makes your site look good for mobile.

So I totally know this but I'm asking for a friend, what is "localhost"?
	Ugh...computer scientists are so into their jargon and abbreviations that it's going to be the
	death of me.  Here are some words/phrases computer science people dish out like everyone is
	supposed to know them.
	localhost: your computer; as in this page cannot be found online as an actual website
		   but you can run it (open with->your favorite browser) on your localhost 
		   to see what it looks like
	AJAX: not a language, just a technique in which you call a javascript function to change
	      something on the webpage without having to refresh it (e.g. on button click, erase
	      some section of text)
	Client side/front end: the web browser that is looking at the web page (e.g. you on facebook)
	Server side/back end: the server (some large computer probably in Iceland that is on 24/7) that 
                              hosts the website; a "middleman" computer that processes and holds data as 
			      it rushes from one computer to another
	Web host: companies "host" a set of servers and will let you use them, sometimes free for limited
		  use--you do not want to host yourself because you don't own a ginormous computer in
		  Iceland that is on 24/7

What about those other web-ish languages.  Like PHP and Ruby and whatnot?
	Those are server side coding languages.  HTML/CSS/JavaScript are client side languages (you run
	and process them through your machine) and server-side languages.  If you work with server side
	languages the code you write gets sent to the server that is hosting your website, and that server
	then distributes the code to whoever happens to go to www.yourwebsite.com.  You want to use server
	side languages when you have a website that requires something like logging in--you don't want your
	personal computer to hold all that data of everyone's log in information.
